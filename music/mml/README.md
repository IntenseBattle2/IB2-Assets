# MML content
MML (or Music Macro Language) is a way to make music using symbols, letters, and numbers. We often work with some tools that use
MML, hence the reason to create this folder. This is often "lower resolution" music. Our "higher resolution" music is stored in
the IB2-Music/music/ directory
